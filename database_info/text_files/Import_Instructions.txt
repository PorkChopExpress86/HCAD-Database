Instructions to Import the Data Text Files into SQL Server 
Extracting Data files and supporting documentation have been zipped into a self-extracting executable file 
called:  
•  Real_acct_owner.zip  
•  Real_building_land.zip  
•  Real_jur_exempt.zip  
• 
•  PP_files.zip for Personal Business property  
•  Hearings_files.zip for Hearing records on both Real and Personal Business property 
•  Code_description_real.zip for Code Descriptions on Real property.  
•  Code_description_pp.zip for Code Descriptions on Personal Business property. 

[Real_acct_ownership_history: current year only] 

Files can be downloaded from here. 
Once the self-extracting executable files (.zip file) are downloaded to your computer, double click the file. 
Your default Zip (typically WinZip by Windows) extraction tool will be used to unzip or copy the files to 
the any location on your computer that you choose. 

Note: each ASCII tab-delimited text file contains header. 

HCAD does not provide technical support for the usage of this data  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Import 

Step 1: Selecting the database 

The first step is to go to the Object Explorer -> [Database] -> Tasks and click the “Import Flat File …” as shown 
in the following figure: 

Once you select the “Import Flat File …” option, you will see a new window containing brief information about 
how to import the flat files, as shown below: 

 
 
 
 
Simply click the “Next” button. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2: Select the file to import 

Click the “Next” button again. 

 
 
 
Step 3: Preview the data 

If your file has loaded successfully, a new window will appear containing a preview of your file, as shown in the 
following figure: 

You can see that the preview contains data from our Text file. Click the “Next” button. 

 
 
Step 4: Modify columns 

Once you click the “Next” button on the “Preview Data” screen, you will see the “Modify Columns” screen 
where you can modify the details of the columns of your table, as shown in the following screenshot: 

In the above figure, you can see that each column in the text file has been assigned a default data type. 
However, you need to change the data type and data size which match each table format (see link: 
pdataCodebook.pdf ) by simply clicking the drop-down list in front of each column as shown below: 

 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, you can also set a column as the Primary key and allow Null values for any column. Once you are 
done with modifying the columns, click the “Next” button. 

 
 
Step 5: Viewing the summary 

A new window displaying the summary of the operation including the name of the Server, Database, Table 
and the file that is being imported will be displayed. This is shown in the following screenshot: 

Click the “Finish” button. 

 
 
Step 6: Process completion 
Depending upon the size of the file, the SQL Server will take some time to import the file. Once the file is 
successfully imported, without any errors, you will see the following screen: 

Since we imported the file into our “_Demo” database in the “arb_hearings_pp” table, the “_Demo” database 
should contain a table named “arb_hearings_pp”. Go to Object Explorer-> Databases -> _Demo-> Tables, here 
you should see your data table “dbo.arb_hearings_pp”, as shown below:
